  2 # Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
  3 #
  4 # This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
  5 # configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
  6 # See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ for detailed information about
  7 # the directives.
  8 #
  9 # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
 10 # what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
 11 # consult the online docs. You have been warned.
 12 #
 13 # The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
 14 #  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
 15 #     whole (the 'global environment').
 16 #  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
 17 #     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
 18 #     These directives also provide default values for the settings
 19 #     of all virtual hosts.
 20 #  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
 21 #     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
 22 #     same Apache server process.
 23 #
 24 # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
 25 # of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
 26 # server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
 27 # with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "foo.log"
 28 # with ServerRoot set to "/etc/apache2" will be interpreted by the
 29 # server as "/etc/apache2/foo.log".
 30 #
 31
 32 ### Section 1: Global Environment
 33 #
 34 # The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
 35 # such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
 36 # can find its configuration files.
 37 #
 38
 39 #
 40 # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
 41 # configuration, error, and log files are kept.
 42 #
 43 # NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
 44 # mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation (available
 45 # at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mpm_common.html#lockfile>);
 46 # you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
 47 #
 48 # Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
 49 #
 50 #ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"
 53 # The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
 54 #
 55 LockFile ${APACHE_LOCK_DIR}/accept.lock
 56
 57 #
 58 # PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
 59 # identification number when it starts.
 60 # This needs to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
 61 #
 62 PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}
 63
 64 #
 65 # Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
 66 #
 67 Timeout 300
 68
 69 #
 70 # KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
 71 # one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
 72 #
 73 KeepAlive On
 74
 75 #
 76 # MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
 77 # during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
 78 # We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
 79 #
 80 MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
 81
 82 #
 83 # KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
 84 # same client on the same connection.
